TERA-proxy Shape Changer. Allows you to change your character appearance.
## Commands: 
* **!sc SHAPE STACK** 
* **`SHAPE`** is head/darkan/fire/ice/wings/marrow/lache/mi/reap/rag/grow/thighs/chest.
* **`STACK`** is number of stacks of the desired effect (4 stacks are the default appearance).
## Usage:
* **`!sc head`**  - applies big head effect on your character, using this command again restores your head
* **`!sc fire`** - applies Kelsaik's fire effect
* **`!sc ice`** - applies Kelsaik's ice effect
* **`!sc marrow`** - applies Marrow Brooch dark effect without transforming your character
* **`!sc lache`** - applies Lachelith's Wrath effect
* **`!sc mi`** - applies Murderous Intent effect (old pvp blackening buff)
* **`!sc wings`**  - gives you Darkan Wings together with Murderous Intent Buff
* **`!sc darkan`** - gives you Darkan Wings (TERA Rewards T10 effect)
* **`!sc rag`** - Ragnarok visual effect
* **`!sc reap`** - Shadow Reaping effect
* **`!sc noct`** - Blue Noctenium Infusion effect
  * None of the effects above uses secondary **STACK** argument!
  * Type the command again to remove effect.
  * All of the effects can be combined together.
* **`!sc grow 7`** - enlarges your character same as if u use Shape changer: Grow item 3x
* **`!sc thighs 1`** - makes your thighs same as if u use Shape changer: Thin thighs 3x
* **`!sc chest 8`** - makes your breasts even larger than if u use in-game item +3 (only works with some costumes)
  * grow, thighs and chest commands always need secondary **STACK** argument!
  * Use **STACK** argument of 4 to remove any of these effects. e.g.`!sc grow 4` restores your size.
  * Possible to also use negative values, stacks are not limited.
* **`!sc reset`** reverts all changes
## Known issues:
* **reset** sometimes leaves you with Murderous Intent eyes if u have too many effects stacked and needs to be used again
 
 Enjoy, use on your own risk :^)
